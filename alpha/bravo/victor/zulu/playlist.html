<div class="collapse" id="come-fly">
    <p>Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away <br>
        If you can use some exotic booze <br>
        There's a bar in far Bombay<br>
        Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away<br></p>
        <p>Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru<br>
        In llama-land there's a one-man band<br>
        And he'll toot his flute for you<br>
        Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue<br></p>
        <p>Once I get you up there<br>
        Where the air is rarefied<br>
        We'll just glide<br>
        Starry-eyed<br>
        Once I get you up there<br>
        I'll be holding you so near<br>
        You may hear<br>
        Angels cheer, 'cause we're together<br></p>
        <p>Weather-wise, it's such a lovely day<br>
        Just say the words and we'll beat the birds<br>
        Down to Acapulco Bay<br>
        It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say<br>
        Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away<br></p>
        <p>Once I get you up there<br>
        Where the air is rarefied<br>
        We'll just glide<br>
        Starry-eyed<br>
        Once I get you up there<br>
        I'll be holding you so near<br>
        You may hear<br>
        Angels cheer, 'cause we're together<br></p>
        <p>Weather-wise, it's such a lovely day<br>
        You just say the words and we'll beat the birds<br>
        Down to Acapulco Bay<br>
        It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say<br>
        Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly<br>
        Pack up, let's fly away</p>

<p>The first time<br>
To get in<br>
The ring with me<br>

You want to<br>
To please everything<br>
Everything feels like<br>
I'm falling hard for you<br>
I'll be falling hard soon</p>
<p>Baby, feel like everything's alright<br>
And you made me<br>
Feel like I'm okay every night<br></p>
<p>If the lights are low<br>
The music's slow<br>
And my hands are all<br>
In your button-down<br>
By a candelight<br>
This feeling right<br>
Staying up all night<br>
All night<br></p>
<p>Baby, feel like everything's alright<br>
Maybe I'm crazy<br>
To even be with you tonight<br></p>
<p>You make me feel like everything's alright<br>
Maybe I'm crazy<br>
To even be with you tonight<br>
Made me feel like everything's alright<br>

<p>14A, window seat, tennis shoes, and faded jeans<br>
Nervous as he tells me it's his first time on a plane<br>
We took off and headed east<br>
I was thumbing through the magazines<br>
He felt like talking and offered me his name<br>
So I asked him how he was<br>
And he smiled and said &quot;well, son&quot;<br></p>
<p>I've been better, I've been worse<br>
I've chased after pretty girls<br>
Seen a couple places that I never thought I'd see<br>
I've walked into harder times, I've walked out the other side<br>
It seems like you end up getting what you need<br>
Yeah, looking down from 30, 000 feet<br>
Life's been good to me<br></p>
<p>I've been out a month or so, another night, another show<br>
A hundred different cities, they all just seem the same<br>
He asked me what it must be like, singing songs under the lights<br>
Well, it's got it's moments just the same as anything<br></p>
<p>I miss my town, I miss my wife<br>
But I'm up here with you tonight<br>
I said I've been better, I've been worse, I have loved a pretty girl<br>
I've seen a couple places that I never thought I'd see<br>
I've walked into harder times, I've walked out the other side<br>
It seems like you end up getting what you need<br>
Yeah, looking down from 30, 000 feet<br>
Life's been good to me<br>
Good to me, yeah<br></p>
<p>Sometimes we can get lost<br>
Living in the here and now<br>
Sometimes it takes the sky<br>
To see what's on the ground<br></p>
<p>I've been better, I've been worse, I've chased after pretty girls<br>
I've seen a couple places that I never thought I'd see<br>
I've walked into harder times, I've walked out the other side<br>
It seems like you end up getting what you need<br>
Yeah, looking down from 30, 000 feet<br>
Life's been good to me</p>

<div class="collapse" id="highlights">
<p>When I'm alone with no words to say<br>
Sometimes I sit and just watch the rain come down<br>
I'm waiting by the window now<br>
It's been awhile<br></p>
<p>I remember back when I was eight<br>
So many hours in a single day I'd wait<br>
Tapping on the fish tank<br>
And watching them swim away<br></p>
<p>So what would it feel like<br>
To be bored again<br>
Waiting on a friend<br>
With no distractions<br></p>
<p>We're not gonna get any younger<br>
Let's slow it down<br>
Waste some time in the here and now<br>
It's not over yet<br>
We'll get older and realize<br>
The little things we did to kill some time<br>
Became the greatest highlights<br></p>
<p>As I get older and the weeks fly by<br>
I try to catch up but I blink my eyes<br>
And now I'm 35<br>
Forgetting what it's like<br>
To watch the tide roll in from the ocean<br></p>
<p>So what would happen if we tried to make it stop<br>
Watch the ticking of the clock<br>
Move in slow motion<br></p>
<p>We're not gonna get any younger<br>
Let's slow it down<br>
Waste some time in the here and now<br>
It's not over yet<br>
We'll get older and realize<br>
The little things we did to kill some time<br>
Became the greatest highlights<br></p>
<p>Highlights, Highlights<br>
Highlights<br></p>
<p>It's never gonna stop now<br>
So we gotta slow it down<br>
Get off this merry-go-round<br>
(Merry-go-round)<br>
With some time to kill<br></p>
<p>It's never gonna stop now<br>
So we gotta slow it down<br>
Get off this merry-go-round<br>
Every moment now<br>
Is a highlight reel<br></p>
<p>We're not gonna get any younger<br>
Let's slow it down<br>
Waste some time in the here and now<br>
It's not over yet<br>
We'll get older and realize<br>
The little things we did to kill some time<br>
Became the greatest highlights<br></p>

<div class="collapse" id="7years">
<p>Once I was seven years old, my mama told me<br>
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely<br>
Once I was seven years old<br></p>
<p>It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger<br>
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker<br>
By 11 smoking herb and drinking burning liquor<br>
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure<br></p>
<p>Once I was 11 years old, my daddy told me<br>
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely<br>
Once I was 11 years old<br></p>
<p>I always had that dream like my daddy before me<br>
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories<br>
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me<br>
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me<br></p>
<p>Once I was 20 years old, my story got told<br>
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely<br>
Once I was 20 years old<br></p>
<p>I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure<br>
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major<br>
I got my boys with me atleast those in favor<br>
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later<br></p>
<p>Once I was 20 years old, my story got told<br>
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me<br>
Once I was 20 years old<br></p>
<p>Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold<br>
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming<br>
Soon we'll be 30 years old<br></p>
<p>I'm still learning about life<br>
My woman brought children for me<br>
So I can sing them all my songs<br>
And I can tell them stories<br>
Most of my boys are with me<br>
Some are still out seeking glory<br>
And some I had to leave behind<br>
My brother I'm still sorry<br></p>
<p>Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61<br>
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one<br>
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once<br>
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month<br></p>
<p>Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold<br>
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me<br>
Soon I'll be 60 years old<br></p>
<p>Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold<br>
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me<br>
Soon I'll be 60 years old<br></p>
<p>Once I was seven years old, my mama told me<br>
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely<br>
Once I was seven years old<br></p>
<p>Once I was seven years old<br></p>

<p>I look around a room that's filled with faces<br>
Every tear a window to the soul<br>
Like silent unsung symphonies<br>
The wild and the wonderful mysteries<br>
Masterpieces I will never know<br></p>
<p>'Cause everybody's looking for some light<br>
You know everybody's looking for<br>
Some light<br></p>
<p>Oh, and when the world is weighing on your shoulder<br>
When the sorrow's heavy on your soul<br>
Carry on and sing it like a soldier<br>
Saying, &quot;Come on! Come on!<br>
We're gonna make it home!&quot;<br></p>
<p>'Cause everybody's looking for some light<br>
You know everybody's looking for some light<br>
So come on, come on<br>
'Cause everybody's looking for<br>
Some light<br></p>
<p>And darkness blurs the vision<br>
Like a veil before our eyes<br>
That love alone is able<br>
To divide<br>
Oh, you know everybody's looking for some light<br>
You know everybody's looking for some light<br></p>
<p>So come on, come on, sing it like a soldier<br>
Come on, come on, you know it ain't over<br>
Everybody's looking for some light<br></p>
<p>So come on, come on, sing it like a soldier<br>
Come on, come on, you know it ain't over<br>
Everybody's looking for some light<br>
You know everybody's looking for some light<br>
You know everybody's looking for-<br></p>

<p>Heard you comin' in the backdoor at 3 a.m.<br>
You spent the night in the hospital sittin' next to your best friend<br>
Woke up three hours later just to go downtown<br>
I've known you long enough to see it's starting to wear you down?<br></p>
<p>Don't put the world on your shoulders<br>
'Cause you know it ain't your load to bear<br></p>
<p>I asked you how you'd be worse and you muster up a smile<br>
I wish you'd take a minute for yourself once and a while<br>
You got a bigger heart than anyone that I have ever known<br>
That you got to see it's killin' me the way you carryin' on so<br></p>
<p>Don't put the world on your shoulders<br>
'Cause you know it ain't your load to bear<br>
Don't put the world on your shoulders<br>
'Cause you know it ain't your load to bear alone<br></p>
<p>Feel the pressure buildin' up inside you<br>
Don't know what to do, don't know what to do<br>
(Feel the pressure risin')<br>
It's too much for one person to hold<br>
Or to hold on to<br></p>
<p>Whoa, don't put the world on your shoulders<br>
'Cause you know it ain't your load to bear alone<br>
Don't put the world on your shoulders, baby<br>
Whoa, it ain't your load to bear<br></p>

<p>I fell in love with the crooked truth<br>
One that I felt like I had to prove<br>
Like I could handle the pressure, on my own<br>
Except I never do<br>
But I put on a fancy show<br>
When I'm caught in the undertow<br>
To hide when it's showing, this pride that I'm holding<br>
I can't let it go<br></p>
<p>Even though<br>
I cannot do this alone<br>
I cannot do this alone<br></p>
<p>I still remember what my mother said<br>
When I was younger, I won't forget<br>
She said to my and brother<br>
Said, &quot;Look out for each other&quot;<br>
And we always did<br></p>
<p>Well later on then I met a girl<br>
The true companion I found in her<br>
I never wanted another<br>
So I tell her I love her<br>
And I always will<br></p>
<p>She needs to know that<br>
I cannot do this alone<br>
I cannot do this alone<br>
I can't handle it anymore<br>
I cannot do this alone<br></p>
<p>I need somebody who knows my name<br>
To shine a light on the darker days<br>
Don't ever let me go<br>
Don't ever let me go<br>
Brother, don't let me forget the truth<br>
But then come after me if I do<br>
Don't let me walk away<br></p>
<p>No, I cannot do this alone<br>
I cannot do this alone<br>
I can't handle it anymore<br>
I cannot do this alone<br>

Oh, oh, oh, share that love<br>

<p>Do I look lonely?<br>
I see the shadows on my face<br>
People have told me I don't look the same<br>
Maybe I lost weight<br>
I'm playing hooky with the best of the best<br>
Put my heart on my chest so that you can see it, too<br>
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall<br>
The lace in your dress tingles my neck, how do I live?<br></p>
<p>The death of a bachelor<br>
Letting the water fall<br>
The death of a bachelor<br>
Seems so fitting for<br>
Happily ever after (woo)<br>
How could I ask for more?<br>
A lifetime of laughter<br>
At the expense of the death of a bachelor<br></p>
<p>I'm cutting my mind off<br>
Feels like my heart is going to burst<br>
Alone at a table for two and I just wanna be served<br>
And when you think of me am I the best you've ever had?<br>
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad<br>
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall<br>
The lace in your dress tingles my neck, how do I live?<br></p>
<p>The death of a bachelor<br>
Oh oh<br>
Letting the water fall<br>
The death of a bachelor<br>
Oh oh<br>

Happily ever after (woo)<br>
How could I ask for more?<br>
A lifetime of laughter<br>

<p>My lover's got humor<br>
She's the giggle at a funeral<br>
Knows everybody's disapproval<br>
I should've worshiped her sooner<br>
If the Heavens ever did speak<br>
She's the last true mouthpiece<br>
Every Sunday's getting more bleak<br>
A fresh poison each week<br>
&quot;We were born sick&quot;, you heard them say it<br>
My church offers no absolutes<br>
She tells me, &quot;Worship in the bedroom&quot;<br>
The only Heaven I'll be sent to<br>
Is when I'm alone with you<br>
I was born sick, but I love it<br>
Command me to be well<br>
A-, Amen, Amen, Amen<br></p>
<p>Take me to church<br>
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies<br>
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife<br>
Offer me that deathless death<br>
Good God, let me give you my life<br>
Take me to church<br>
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies<br>
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife<br>
Offer me that deathless death<br>
Good God, let me give you my life<br></p>
<p>If I'm a pagan of the good times<br>
My lover's the sunlight<br>
To keep the Goddess on my side<br>
She demands a sacrifice<br>
Drain the whole sea<br>
Get something shiny<br>
Something meaty for the main course<br>
That's a fine looking high horse<br>
What you got in the stable?<br>
We've a lot of starving faithful<br>
That looks tasty<br>
That looks plenty<br>
This is hungry work<br></p>
<p>Take me to church<br>
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies<br>
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife<br>
Offer me my deathless death<br>
Good God, let me give you my life<br>
Take me to church<br>
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies<br>
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife<br>
Offer me my deathless death<br>
Good God, let me give you my life<br></p>
<p>No masters or kings when the ritual begins<br>
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin<br>
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene<br>
Only then I am human<br>
Only then I am clean<br>
Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen<br></p>
<p>Take me to church<br>
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies<br>
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife<br>
Offer me that deathless death<br>
Good God, let me give you my life<br>
Take me to church<br>
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies<br>
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife<br>
Offer me that deathless death<br>

<div class="collapse" id="webelong">
<p>We belong together<br>
Like the open seas and shores<br>
Wedded by the planet force<br>
We've all been spoken for<br></p>
<p>The hammer may strike, be dead on the ground<br>
A net to my hand, a cross on his crown<br>
We're done if, we're undone<br>
Finished if we are incomplete<br>
As one, we are everything<br>
We are everything we need<br></p>
<p>We belong together<br>
Like the open seas and shores<br>
Wedded by the planet force<br>
We've all been spoken for<br></p>
<p>What good is a life<br>
With no one to share?<br>
The light of the moon<br>
The honor of a swear<br>
The kingdom of men, is hollow within <br>
Without depth, without the care <br>
That it takes to make a perfect love <br>
The passion to find the other truth <br>
To visualize the straightened from the skewed <br>
To trade a common comfort for a view <br>
We can try to live the way of which you speak<br>
Taste the milk of your mother Earth's love<br>
Spread the word of consciousness you see<br>
We are everything we need<br></p>
<p>We belong together<br>
Like the open seas and shores<br>
Wedded by the planet force<br>
We've all been spoken for<br></p>
<p>All this indecision<br>
All this independent strength<br>
Still we've got our hearts on safe<br>
We've got our hearts on safe<br></p>
<p>Someday when you're lonely<br>
Sometime after all this bliss<br>
Somewhere lost in emptiness<br>
I hope you find this gift<br>
I hope you find this gift<br>
I hope you find this gift<br></p>

You told me that you wish that you would have a lover<br>
I told you I was lonely too<br></p>

The green outweighs the blue<br>
I'll make you come alive, I know you feel it too<br></p>
<p>Before I opened up my mouth, you shut it for me<br>
You just can't reciprocate<br>
Frankly it's alright that you don't see the same things<br>
I'll just sit right here and wait<br></p>
<p>I look into the sky, this hurt is never healing<br>
But you make me come alive and I can't stop this feeling<br></p>
<p>I'll wait for you<br>
Will you wait for me too?<br>
I'll wait for you<br>
Waiting's all that I can do. <br></p>

Will you wait for me too?<br>
I'll wait for you<br>
Waiting's all that I can do<br>

It's been a million miles<br>
I'll be the first to say<br>

Whoa, I want to be where you are<br>

This is the part where I stay where I stand<br>
Oh, I want to be where you are<br>
Tell me you're with me so far<br></p>
<p>So let this be the chance<br>
The only one that counts<br>
You're love will be my last<br>
Until my life runs out<br></p>
<p>Until then I won't rest<br>
Till then I will not stop<br>
Untill I hear the words<br>
All I need is a yes<br></p>

Oh, I want to be where you are<br>
Tell me you're with me so far<br></p>

And I'm clutching to each word you say<br>
If only the space<br>
Forgetting every mistake<br>
That I made<br></p>
<p>I'm beginning to change<br>
'Cause I feel all my fears slip away<br>
And each look at you<br>
Is a moment I choose to embrace<br></p>
<p>And that I want to be where you are<br>
I feel the same as I did from the start<br>
Whoa, I want to be where you are<br>
And I'm willing to get there<br></p>

Do you think you can tell?<br></p>

Your heroes for ghosts?<br>
Hot ashes for trees?<br>
Hot air for a cool breeze?<br>
Cold comfort for change?<br>
Did you exchange<br>
A walk-on part in the war<br>
For a leading role in a cage?<br></p>

We're just two lost souls<br>
Swimming in a fish bowl<br>

Gave you permission, gave you control<br>
Show me the world that I didn't know<br>

Will you be there for me, for me<br>
When I fall down<br>
When I can’t see<br>
Will you be there for me (for me)<br></p>

Faster every day<br>
I won't let it pass you by<br>
I'll never walk away<br></p>
<p>I will be there for you<br>
Any way you need me to<br>
You don't have to walk alone<br>
On this winding road<br>
If you need to cry<br>
If you need to laugh<br>
If you need a second chance<br>
We all do<br>
I will be there for you<br>
I will be there for you<br></p>
<p>Don't have to be anything to be<br>
Worthy of your love<br>
The steady beat of your heart that you keep<br>
Is morе than enough<br>
And it's far too easy<br>
To miss the bеauty in the simple things<br>
But I won't miss this chance to show you<br>
What you mean to me<br></p>
<p>I will be there for you<br>
Any way you need me to<br>
You don't have to walk alone<br>
On this winding road<br>
If you need to cry<br>
If you need to laugh<br>
If you need a second chance<br>
We all do<br>
I will be there for you<br>
I will be there for you<br></p>
<p>It's gonna be okay<br>
It's gonna be all okay<br>
It's gonna be okay<br>
It's gonna be all okay<br>
Wherever you are<br>
Wherever you go<br>
You're never alone<br>
And I'll be there<br></p>
<p>I will be there for you<br>
Any way you need me to<br>
You don't have to walk alone<br>
On this winding road<br>
If you need to cry<br>
If you need to laugh<br>
If you need a second chance<br>
We all do<br>
I will be there for you<br>
I will be there for you<br></p>
<p>In every circumstance<br>
You know I'll be there<br>
You know I'll be there<br></p>
<p>I will be there for you<br></p>

<h3>25. No Plan</h3>

<p>For starts<br>
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart<br>
Or feel complete, baby<br>
Why would you make out of words<br>
A cage for your own bird?<br>
When it sings so sweet<br>
The screaming, heaving fuckery of the world?<br></p>
<p>Why would you offer her name<br>
To the same old tired pain?<br>
When all things come from nothin'<br>
And, honey, if nothing's gained<br></p>
<p>My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand<br>
It's how I know now that you understand<br></p>
<p>There's no plan, there's no race to be run<br>
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun<br>
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come<br>
I'll be your man if you got love to get done<br>
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade<br>
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late<br>
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein<br>
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again<br></p>
<p>Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard<br>
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby<br>
But your secret is safe with me<br>
'Cause if secrets were like seeds<br>
Keep my body from the fire<br>
Hire a gardener for my grave<br></p>
<p>Your secret is safe with me<br>
And if secrets were like seeds<br>
When I'm lying under marble<br>
Marvel at flowers you'll have made<br></p>
<p>My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand<br>
It's how I know now that you understand<br></p>
<p>There's no plan, there's no race to be run<br>
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the sun<br>
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come<br>
I'll be your man if you got love to get done<br>
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade<br>
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late<br>
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein<br>
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again<br></p>
<p>My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand<br>
It's how I know now that you understand<br>
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand<br>
I shouldn't hope to know, but here I stand<br></p>
<p>There's no plan, there's no race to be run<br>
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun<br>
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come<br>
I'll be your man if you got love to get done<br>
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade<br>
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late<br>
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein<br>
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again<br></p>

    "Purpose is everything"<br>
    A hopeless romantic sings<br>
    Give me my chemicals<br>
    I've fallen in love with one <br>
    'Cause it never does me wrong<br>
    Except when it's gone<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why don't you wake me up from my sleep tonight?<br>
  Why don't you wake me up from my sleep tonight?<br>
  And in the morning light, I will face you<br>
  Why don't you wake me up from this wasted life?<br>
  And in the morning light, I will face you<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindsight is everything <br>
      In the darkness that morning brings <br>
      The shadows from sunrise <br>
      The contrast is deafening <br>
      From the blur of the midnight street <br>
      To the morning of black and white <br>
    </p>
    <p>Savior, save me!</p>
    <p>Am I alone?!</p>

<h3>27. Contre Qui, Rose?</h3>

<div class="collapse" id="contrequi">
  <p>
    Contre qui, rose,<br>
avez-vous adopte<br>
ces epines?<br>
Votre joie trop fine<br>
vous a-t-elle forcee<br>
de devenir cette chose<br>
armee?<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Mais de qui vous protege <br>
cette arme exageree? <br>
Combien d'ennemis vous ai-je <br>
enleves <br>
qui ne la craignaient point? <br>
Au contraire, d'ete en automne, <br>
vous blessez les soins <br>
qu'on vous donne. <br>
  </p><hr>
  <p>
    Against whom, rose, <br>
have you assumed <br>
these thorns? <br>
Is it your too fragile joy <br>
that forced you <br>
to become <br>
this armed thing? <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    But from whom does it protect you, <br>
this exaggerated defense? <br>
How many enemies have I <br>
lifted from you <br>
who did not fear it at all? <br>
On the contrary, from summer to autumn <br>
you wound the affection <br>
that is given you. <br>

<p>
  Woke up in a hotel <br>
Three hours of sleep last night <br>
Only thing real to me is a thirteen-hour drive <br>
I lost my convictions <br>
I have risked my life <br>
I've seen the face of God through miles of black ice <br>
</p>
<p>
  Oh, I just wanted you to know <br>
  What I'd give up to give myself to you <br>
</p>
<p>
  I had my foundations <br>
But I threw them away <br>
Only thing real to me was moving <br>
The rest was fake <br>
But I've got new direction <br>
I feel winds of change <br>
Still I've got my good reasons to stay the same <br>
</p>
<p>
  No I don't need it anymore <br>
The hotel floors the stage the lights the road <br>
All I want to do is build a home <br>
You've got my heart and my soul <br>
</p>

  Will you fight for me again? <br>
  Will you fight for me? <br>
