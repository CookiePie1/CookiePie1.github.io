                        <em>Magnetos</em>, or “mags” are electrical devices found on piston aircraft engines such as the Piper J-3 Cub. The Cub is equipped with two mags, left and right. In the magneto, the engine’s rotational motion is mechanically coupled with a rotor connected to a magnet, which spins within loops of copper wire. Each magneto supplies voltage to power one of two spark plugs per engine cylinder, of which there are four. The piper cub did not originally have an electrical system. The spark plugs use a high voltage to create a spark which ignites a fuel-air mixture in the engine cylinder.
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Name and explain the principle that this device relies on to create electrical energy from rotational kinetic energy. [2 pts]</li>
                            <li>The Piper Cub needs to be <em>hand-propped</em> - that is, a person must stand in front of the airplane and physically spin the propellor. Explain why this needs to happen. It may be helpful to know that the engine crankshaft on piston airplanes is directly connected to the propellor. [2 pts]</li>
                            <li>Automobiles are equipped with a battery and alternator. Alternators work similarly in principle to magnetos, but they supply electrical energy to the battery and not the spark plugs directly. When you start a car, you don’t need to open the hood every time and spin the crankshaft yourself. (Frankly, that’d be quite ridiculous). Cars are generally not equipped with magnetos. Given the information in this problem, infer why cars can start with the turn of a key and the Piper Cub needs to be hand-propped. [3 pts]</li>
                            <li>In your opinion, which is the better system? Defend your response. You will not lose points based on which side you take. Consider the context in which each system is used, and the safety requirements that each might have. For example, think about what would happen if the engine failed in an airplane versus a car.
